The following code snippet demonstrates the corrected implementation.  Data is now passed to the `onAuthStateChanged` listener, preventing scope-related issues.

```javascript
let myVariable = 'initial value'; // Initialize variable

function myFunction() {
  firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in.
      const uid = user.uid;

      // Pass the variable as an argument and update within the scope
      updateMyVariable(myVariable, uid); 
    } else {
      // No user is signed in.
      console.log('User is not signed in');
    }
  });
}

function updateMyVariable(variable, uid) {
  const updatedVariable = variable + ' - updated by user: ' + uid;
  console.log(updatedVariable); 
  //Further action to update the variable accordingly
  myVariable = updatedVariable; 
}

```
This solution ensures that data is managed correctly within the scope of the listener and that any modifications do not cause unintended side effects.
