# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Scope Issue
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener within a nested function. The problem arises when attempting to access or modify variables outside the listener's scope, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.  The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem
The primary issue is improper scope management when handling authentication state changes within nested functions.  Attempting to access or modify variables from the parent function's scope directly within the `onAuthStateChanged` callback can result in `undefined` values or unexpected data modifications, especially in scenarios with multiple listeners.

## Solution
The solution involves passing the necessary data into the `onAuthStateChanged` callback or using a more appropriate method for managing data access and modification, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior across authentication states.
