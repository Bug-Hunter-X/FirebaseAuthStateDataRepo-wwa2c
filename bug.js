The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to the use of the `onAuthStateChanged` listener within a nested function.  The issue arises when the listener attempts to access or modify data outside of its immediate scope, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in.
      const uid = user.uid;
      // Attempting to access data outside the scope, causing potential errors.
      console.log(myVariable); // Error! myVariable is not defined in this scope 

      // Attempting to modify global variable outside the scope.
      myVariable = 'updated'; // Error! Potential issues if multiple listeners are accessing and modifying simultaneously. 
    } else {
      // No user is signed in.
      console.log('User is not signed in');
    }
  });
}
```
